# generateBrackets

You are given an integer n, which represents the number of pairs of parentheses. You need to write a function that generates all possible combinations of well-formed parentheses using n pairs.

Suppose n = 2. We need to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses using 2 pairs of parentheses.

The possible combinations are ['(())', '()()'].

The first combination is (()), where the inner parentheses are well-formed. The second combination is ()(), where both pairs of parentheses are well-formed.

Thus, the expected output is ['(())', '()()'].
